# General Signal Generator  

This repository contains the implementation of a **General Signal Generator** developed using **MATLAB App Designer**, offering a GUI-based solution for designing and analyzing various signals.  

## Overview  
The project allows users to define, manipulate, and visualize signals with an interactive and user-friendly interface. The tool supports multiple signal types and provides functionalities for performing signal operations.  

## Features  
- **Signal Definition**:  
  - Input parameters such as sampling frequency, time scale, and number of breakpoints.  
  - Supports signal types:  
    - **DC signal**: Define amplitude.  
    - **Ramp signal**: Define slope and intercept.  
    - **General order polynomial**: Specify amplitude, power, and intercept.  
    - **Exponential signal**: Specify amplitude and exponent.  
    - **Sinusoidal signal**: Define amplitude, frequency, and phase.  
- **Signal Operations**:  
  - Perform various operations, including:  
    - Amplitude scaling.  
    - Time reversal.  
    - Time shifting.  
    - Signal expansion.  
    - Signal compression.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Display the original and modified signals in the time domain for analysis.
